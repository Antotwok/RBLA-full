            At Varnam, we take pride in preserving and promoting the ancient art of block printing, a tradition that dates back centuries in the rich tapestry of Indian culture. Block printing is more than just a craft; it's a celebration of heritage, creativity, and craftsmanship. Originating in regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat, block printing has been passed down through generations, with artisans honing their skills and refining techniques over centuries. At Varnam, we pay homage to this heritage by working with master craftsmen who embody the spirit of this timeless art form. Block printing is a labor-intensive process that requires precision, patience, and passion. It begins with the carving of intricate designs onto wooden blocks, each meticulously crafted to perfection. These blocks are then dipped into natural dyes made from plants, minerals, and other organic sources, ensuring vibrant colors and eco-friendly production.
