order placing logic -- like the sales report module for the admin cant be done because ths would rewuire the overhaul changes in the project adn the users also cant be fetched for that
admin- two modules not possible -- sales report and the users 




[I understand. The issue is clear now - the products in the orders don't have their store field set correctly. Here's what's happening:
We have 151 orders in the database
All orders have products
But the store field in the products is undefined instead of "varnam"
To fix this, you'll need to:
Update the products in your orders to have the correct store field. You can do this by:
Either updating your order creation logic to set the store field when new orders are created
Or running a database update to set the store field for existing orders
The fix would involve either:
javascript
CopyInsert
// When creating new orders, make sure products have store field
products: [{
    name: "Product Name",
    price: 100,
    quantity: 1,
    store: "varnam"  // This is missing in your current orders
}]
Would you like me to help you create a script to update the existing orders with the correct store field? Or would you prefer to modify the order creation logic to include the store field for new orders?

-- frankly means the order data like the table doesnt have the store in its fields so we cant fileter the orders related to it .. ]]
