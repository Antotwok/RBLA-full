# RBLA2 Project Documentation

## Overview
The `RBLA2` project is an e-commerce platform with support for multiple user roles: **Customer**, **Admin**, and **Super-Admin**. This documentation outlines the project structure, file organization, and development guidelines to ensure consistency, scalability, and ease of collaboration across the team. It addresses where to place files, how to integrate new features, and best practices for maintaining the project.

## Project Structure
The `RBLA2` project is divided into `frontend` and `backend` directories. Below is a table summarizing the key directories and their contents, organized by role (Customer, Admin, Super-Admin):

| **Directory**               | **Subfolder** | **Description**                                      | **Examples**                          |

## File Placement Guidelines
Use this section to determine where to place new files or resolve doubts about file locations. Each role has its dedicated subfolder to maintain organization and avoid conflicts.

### Frontend
- **Pages**:
  - If you’re working on a customer-facing page (e.g., homepage, product listing, cart), place it in `frontend/src/pages/customer/` with its corresponding CSS file (e.g., `Home.jsx` and `Home.css`).
  - For admin-related pages (e.g., order management, customer management), use `frontend/src/pages/admin/` (e.g., `Orders.jsx` and `Orders.css`).
  - Superadmin pages (e.g., unit management, worker management) belong in `frontend/src/pages/superadmin/` (e.g., `Units.jsx` and `Units.css`).

- **Components**:
  - Customer-specific UI components (e.g., product cards, navigation bars for customers) go in `frontend/src/components/customer/` (e.g., `ProductCard.jsx` and `ProductCard.css`).
  - Admin-specific components (e.g., tables for orders, customer lists) go in `frontend/src/components/admin/` (e.g., `OrderTable.jsx` and `OrderTable.css`).
  - Superadmin components stay in `frontend/src/components/superadmin/` (e.g., `superadminlogin.jsx`).
  - If a component is reusable across roles (e.g., a generic `Navbar.jsx` or `Footer.jsx`), place it in the root `frontend/src/components/` to avoid duplication.

- **Services**:
  - Customer API services (e.g., fetching products, managing carts) go in `frontend/src/services/customer/` (e.g., `productsApi.js`, `cartApi.js`).
  - Admin API services (e.g., managing orders, viewing customer data) go in `frontend/src/services/admin/` (e.g., `ordersApi.js`, `customersApi.js`).
  - Superadmin API services remain in `frontend/src/services/` (e.g., `unitsApi.js`, `workersapi.js`).

- **Routing**:
  - Customer routes are defined in `frontend/routes/customerroutes.js`.
  - Admin routes are defined in `frontend/routes/adminroutes.js`.
  - Superadmin routes are defined in `frontend/routes/superadminroutes.js`.
  - Update `frontend/src/App.js` to include all routes, ensuring role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access appropriately.

### Backend
- **Controllers**:
  - Customer-related controller logic (e.g., product fetching, order placement) goes in `backend/controllers/customer/` (e.g., `ProductController.js`, `OrderController.js`).
  - Admin-related controller logic (e.g., managing orders, customers) goes in `backend/controllers/admin/` (e.g., `OrderController.js`, `CustomerController.js`).
  - Superadmin controllers remain in `backend/controllers/superadmin/` (e.g., `AdminController.js`, `unitController.js`).

- **Models**:
  - Use the existing models in `backend/models/` (e.g., `Customer.js`, `Order.js`, `Product.js`). Add new models only if necessary, ensuring compatibility with existing schemas.

- **Middleware**:
  - Customer middleware (e.g., session validation) goes in `backend/middleware/customermiddleware.js`.
  - Admin middleware (e.g., role-based authorization) goes in `backend/middleware/adminmiddleware.js`.
  - Superadmin middleware remains in `backend/middleware/superadminmiddleware.js`.

- **Routes**:
  - Customer routes are defined in `backend/routes/customerRoutes.js`.
  - Admin routes are defined in `backend/routes/adminRoutes.js`.
  - Superadmin routes are in `backend/routes/superadmin/` and related files (e.g., `superadminauthroutes.js`, `unitRoutes.js`, `workerRoutes.js`).
  - Shared routes (e.g., product-related) can stay in `backend/routes/productRoutes.js`.

---

## Best Practices and Considerations
Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and scalability:

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement middleware to ensure only authorized users can access specific routes. For example:
  - Use `customermiddleware.js` to restrict customer routes to logged-in customers.
  - Use `adminmiddleware.js` to restrict admin routes to authenticated admins.
  - Use `superadminmiddleware.js` for superadmin routes.
- Use JWT or session-based authentication to validate roles in both front-end and back-end.

### Reusability
- Evaluate components and services for reusability across roles. For instance:
  - If a `ProductCard` component is needed in both customer and admin interfaces, place it in `frontend/src/components/` (root) instead of duplicating it.
  - Similarly, shared API services (e.g., `productRoutes.js`) should be accessible to all roles but controlled via middleware.

### Testing
- Update tests in `frontend/src/setupTests.js` to cover new customer and admin functionalities.
- If back-end tests exist, ensure they include tests for customer and admin controllers and routes.

### Documentation
- Update this `README.md` (or create a `docs/` folder for detailed documentation) to reflect new features, file placements, and changes.
- Document any custom implementations, such as specific API endpoints or UI components, to assist new team members.

## Development Workflow
1. **Clone the Repository**: Ensure you have the latest version of `RBLA2` from the source repository.
2. **Identify Your Role**: Determine whether you’re working on customer, admin, or super-admin features.
3. **File Placement**: Use the table and guidelines above to place new files in the appropriate directories.
4. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for new code, updating existing test suites as needed.
5. **Review and Merge**: Submit pull requests for review, ensuring code adheres to this structure and best practices.

## Common Questions and Answers
### Where should I put a new customer page (e.g., `Checkout.jsx`)?
Place it in `frontend/src/pages/customer/` with its CSS file (`Checkout.css`).

### Where do admin components (e.g., `OrderTable.jsx`) go?
Place them in `frontend/src/components/admin/` with their CSS file (`OrderTable.css`).

### How do I create a new API endpoint for admin order management?
- Create a controller in `backend/controllers/admin/OrderController.js`.
- Define the route in `backend/routes/adminRoutes.js`.
- Use `adminmiddleware.js` to restrict access to authenticated admins.

### Can I reuse a component across roles?
Yes, place reusable components (e.g., `Navbar.jsx`) in `frontend/src/components/` if they’re not role-specific.
